KVStore
=================

Key value store

## Url

## How to use 
1. You can set the value for a key
2. You can search for a key, and show the value listed for it


## Start the service

```
npm install
node app.js
```

## Run the tests

```
npm run test
```

### Future Enhancements

We'd want to use a cloud datastore for storing the key value pairs, rather than just using memory. Currently, we store the data in a Map in memory.
